# What are we building?

This tutorial will build a Safe App that enables us to migrate all the assets from a Safe to any other different wallets in a single transaction. In addition, you will learn about smart contract wallets, multi-signature transaction flow, and batched transactions.

The tutorial contains several sections:

- Overview
- Bootstrapping the Safe App
- Retrieving the assets
- Preparing the transaction and sending it
- Additional: tracking the transaction progress
